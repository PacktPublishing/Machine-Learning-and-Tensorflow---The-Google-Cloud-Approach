## About the Video Course
Interested in the field of machine learning? Then this course is for you! This course has been designed by experts so that we can share our knowledge and help you learn complex theory, algorithms and coding libraries in a simple way. We will walk you step-by-step into the world of machine learning. With every tutorial you will develop new skills and improve your understanding of this challenging yet lucrative field of ML. This course is fun and exciting, but at the same time we dive deep into machine ;earning. We will be covering the following topics in a well crafted way:- Tensors and TensorFlow on the Cloud - what neural networks, machine learning and deep learning really are, how neurons work and how neural networks are trained. - Datalab, linear regressions, placeholders, variables, image processing, MNIST, K- Nearest Neighbors, gradient descent, Softmax and more
